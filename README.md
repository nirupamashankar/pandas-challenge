Three observable trends from data:

--Overall rate of passing was lower in larger schools than small and mid sized schools. The small and mid size schools had similar passing rates. 

--District schools had a lower passing percent than charter schools

-- Amount of money spent per student did not translate into improved performance. Schools that had lower per student budget had a higher passing rate than those schools which had higher amount of money allocated per student.
